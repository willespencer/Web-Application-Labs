            <p class = "desc">Often times, when people discuss politics, they stay within their own bubbles. Our mission is to enable the user to compare news from different sides of the political spectrum, and to inspire those reading to take active political action. </p>

                Our Method
            </h1>
            <p class = "desc">
                The political spectrum bar uses a table which corresponds news sources with a value, depending on how right or left winged they are. Based on those values, news sources closest to the section of the spectrum selected are displayed. The intention here is to enable users to step outside their political bubble. When a user feels that something in the law needs to be changed, they can enter their address and zip code to identify their local and national legislators, so that they have all the information necessary to help make the change they deem necessary. 
            </p>

                We intend to eventually bring functionality where we can connect users with other advocates and campaigns through Phone2Action, to further expand the reach of the user. We would also like to expand upon our range of sources, especially on the right side of the political spectrum.
